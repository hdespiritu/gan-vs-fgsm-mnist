TODO:
	(TASK1) Generate GAN images by training on (0-30,000) for MNIST and test robustness on classifier
	trained on (30,001 - 50,000 && 20,000 adversarial) using a mix of (50,001 - 60,000 & 10,000 adversarial)


CONSIDERATIONS:
	-ensure that GAN training examples does NOT overlap with victim-classifier training examples
		(ONCE: do a hash of images and compare)
	-ensure victim-classifier training is comparable across different attack scenarios in 
	  	terms of the number of training examples.

TODO:
	(TASK2) How to add perturbation instead of generating image?
