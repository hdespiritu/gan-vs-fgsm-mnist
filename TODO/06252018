-ROC Curve AUC
  http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc.html

-GAN data
  TFGAN, MaskGAN, etc
  
  Attempted:
  LeakGAN (very slow, reinforcement learning based adversarial examples)
  rnn.wgan (already was attempted and apparently not great)
  seqgan-text-tensorflow (requires tensorflow 1.0)
    -see (https://github.com/Currie32/Chatbot-from-Movie-Dialogue/issues/7)

-Translation???
  Sogou, NMT checkpoints
  Tensorflow alternatives??
