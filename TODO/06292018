-mulithread flip stats
-vim search & replace category change discrepancies (compare with loading one-by-one)
-**whitebox adversarial gives odd output
-charcnn large dataset (eg 4million+) requires long training (over 100K steps ===> 10+hours)
 Note: total combined data is ~10million examples

-combining datasets in an efficent (tensorflow best practices), automated way
-speed up confusion matrix generation (currently slows down training alot)
-plotting ROC curve for test (& train?) steps
  Note: related to changing confidence levels
-Other useful visualizations? (need to be fast to generate or at least not slow down training, ie possible to generate from data saved in checkpoint?)
